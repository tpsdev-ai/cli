// Changelog fragment files (cli#449), ported from bob's
// scripts/changelog-fragments.mjs (bob#236), itself ported from flair's (flair#835).
//
// PROBLEM. A PR's changelog entry went into the single `[Unreleased]` block at
// the top of CHANGELOG.md, so two PRs that each added an entry could make
// overlapping edits there, and the second to merge could conflict. The cost is not the
// resolution — it is that a merge/rebase to resolve DISMISSES the existing
// approvals, so a conflict can buy a full second review round for zero content
// change.
//
// FIX. One file per change under `.changelog/unreleased/`. PRs whose fragments
// have distinct filenames no longer share an edit to `[Unreleased]`; two PRs
// that add the same filename with different contents can conflict on that file. `promote` writes the
// fragments into a `## [<version>]` section below `[Unreleased]` and deletes them.
//
// FILE NAMING: `.changelog/unreleased/<category>-<slug>.md`
//   category  one of added|changed|deprecated|removed|fixed|security
//             (Keep a Changelog), in lowercase and matched exactly, taken
//             from the text BEFORE the first hyphen
//   slug      anything else; make it descriptive, uniqueness is on you (a PR
//             number is a fine slug, but is not required — the branch is pushed
//             before the PR number exists)
//
// FILE CONTENT: the entry as it should appear under its `### Category` heading,
// INCLUDING the leading `- `. Every continuation line is indented with spaces
// only, an even number of them, and every nonblank one by at least 2.
// Reading decodes the file as UTF-8 and refuses it by name when its bytes are not
// valid UTF-8, instead of reading them with replacement characters; it then
// trims the whitespace at the end of the file. Assembly joins the fragments as
// read: no reflow, no re-indent, no re-wrapping. That is
// deliberate. The failure this design exists to prevent is silent
// content loss, and every normalisation step is somewhere content can be
// silently altered. A fragment that does not already look like a list item is a
// hard error, not something to be helpfully fixed up.
//
// USAGE
//   node scripts/changelog-fragments.mjs render      print the assembled section
//   node scripts/changelog-fragments.mjs list        one line per fragment
//   node scripts/changelog-fragments.mjs check       validate; non-zero on error
//   node scripts/changelog-fragments.mjs promote <version> [--date=YYYY-MM-DD]
//                                                    write the section into
//                                                    CHANGELOG.md and delete the
//                                                    fragments; --date must be a
//                                                    real date (default: today, UTC)
